          <h5><strong>Why such a limited supply of NFTs?
            </strong></h5>
          <p className="mt-3">1140nft is limited to a supply of 1140 NFTs. The low supply cap is designed to make 1140DAO attractive as both a short-term and long-term investment.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">In the short-term, the low supply will stimulate secondary market sales for those who wish to speculate or trade the NFT. 
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3"> In the long-term, the limited supply acts as a cap on the number of <strong>1140DAO</strong> members, which makes the DAO exclusive and increases the return on investment per member through the profit sharing mechanisms.
          </p>
          <h5 className="faq"><strong>How long will the project take?
          </strong></h5>
          <p className="mt-3"> Building value takes time. This is a real-world capital project that creates new property and equity. This is a complex process that will take multiple years. 
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">Profit sharing will begin once construction is complete and will continue for the life of the DAO. That being said, there will be opportunities for investors to realize a return on investment throughout the life of the project.
          </p>

          <h5 className="faq"><strong>Where do I stake my NFT?</strong></h5>
          <p className="mt-3">You donâ€™t. You have full control to buy and hold, or speculate along the way. As long as you simply hold the NFT in your wallet you will accrue points toward <strong>1140DAO</strong>. Long term holders will receive the most benefits in <strong>1140DAO</strong>.
          </p>

          <h5 className="faq"><strong>What is 1140DAO?</strong></h5>
          <p className="mt-3">DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. <strong>1140DAO</strong> will be essentially an exclusive club of <strong>1140nft</strong> holders. All members of <strong>1140DAO</strong> will have governance and voting rights, profit sharing and access benefits.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3"><strong>1140DAO</strong> will be established once construction is complete, but points toward the DAO start accruing immediately when an <strong>1140nft</strong> is purchased or traded.
